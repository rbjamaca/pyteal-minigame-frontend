## Algorand Mini-Game


### Overview

This is a simple game built with Algorand's Pyteal where a user plays as a warrior fighting a monster boss. This makes use of Pyteal's `global and local states` to store values that will be used in the game. The player's and the boss' stats are kept at default values at level 1. They both have `Health`, `Attack`, and `Defense`. Once the player defeats a boss, their level will be increased by 1. Every time a player increases levels, they can spend `twenty (20) points` to add to their stats, while the boss' stats increase steadily with the player's level.

## Game Mechanics

### Connecting with Pera Algo Wallet

To be able to play, the user needs to connect first using their `Pera Algo Wallet` by scanning a QR code generated by the dApp.

### Opting in

The user also needs to `opt-in` to the smart contract by pressing the `Register` button. This will set the initial values of their player stats, including their level which starts at `level 1`.

### Start Battle

Once the player's stats are set up, the boss' stats will be displayed, and also a `Fight Boss` button which if pressed and confirmed, will set up the boss stats for the specific level and start the battle. 

### In Battle

While in the battle, the player can pick a type of attack which gives a chance to land a `critical hit` which deals triple the player's normal damage. The likeliness of critical chance is determined by generating a `pseudo-random number` on the smart contract by implementing `linear congruential recurrence relation` and if it matches with the player's selected number, it will deal the critical damage.

If the player misses the critical hit, they can still land a `double attack` through chance (via a randomly generated number from 1 - 4) that will be passed as an argument to the smart contract. The boss also have the chance to hit a `double attack` through the same method.

### Leveling up

After defeating a boss, the player will enter a state where they can add `20 points` to their current stats which they can equally divide among `Health`, `Attack`, and `Defense` based on their preference.

### Defeated

Once the player has been defeated by the boss, they can restart the level by pressing the `Resurrect` button, this will replenish their HP based on their current Health and start the battle again with the current boss.
